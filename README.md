## My solution to the Josephus Problem, using python!
I came up witht the formula myself, as a challenge, meaning i did this without looking anything up.

If you don't already know the Josephus Problem, go here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem

## formula.py
Regular formula calculation, uaing circleSize as the amount of people

## formula_arguments.py
Same as above, but using argparser to make using it a bit easier.

All in all, a pretty useless project, but i liked making it!
